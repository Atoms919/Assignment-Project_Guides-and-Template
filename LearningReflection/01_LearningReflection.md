> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- 
I found this testing exercise quite trivial but it is a good way to start and acquire the bases to writting test cases and report .

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- 
To write the test cases, I visited the page I wanted to test and tried to find everything that could be tested on it and what the expect result was for different scenarios, for exemple what was the minimum and maximum lenght of a username as well as the resticted symbols. 

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 -     
Not really.

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- 
To edit the files, I used visual studio code (but I couldn't open the pdf on it). 
     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
-
I did not get any trouble.

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
-
I had used github before for coding projects so it wasn't too much trouble.

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- 
I don't think those test cases would be automated and I don't know much about the differences in Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other.

## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- 
Skills and competencies in-demand in software testing:
 - Programming Proficiency (Python, Java, JavaScript)
 - Automation Tools (Selenium, Appium, TestComplete, or JMeter)
 - Test Case Design and Management
 - Bug reporting

## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- 
Technical and soft skills I need in my resume :
 - Learn automation Tools (Selenium, Appium, TestComplete, or JMeter)
 - Develop my Test Case Design and Management (I just have this course for now) 
 - Develop my Bug reporting (I just have this course for now) 

## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
-
The project was effective in bridging theoretical knowledge with practical application. It allowed me to:
 - Understand the process of identifying testable features and creating detailed test cases for specific scenarios.
 - Gain hands-on experience with tools like GitHub and refine the skill of documenting and reporting issues systematically.
By working through real-world examples, I developed a stronger appreciation for the discipline required in test planning and execution. This project emphasized the importance of structure, attention to detail, and iterative learning, which are critical for a career in software testing.
